Kikai Labs Maker 3D Printer Models - Case
=========================================

The case is designed to be printed on three sheets of 90x60cm MDF plywood, 5.5mm thickness.

This is what it looks like when built:

There spool filament holder is incorporated into these three sheets, but
you can also print them separately with the file named "Spool Holder.dxf".

There are minor changes in the design from the picture, including carrying handles,
improved Z-stop bolt for use with a knob, a slot for the heated bed cables beneath
the building plate, etc.
