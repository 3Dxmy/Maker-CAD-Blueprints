Kikai Labs Maker 3D Printer Models
==================================

![alt text](https://github.com/kikailabs/Maker-CAD-Blueprints/raw/inverted-T/artwork/Kikailabs_Maker.jpg "Kikai Labs Maker 3D Printer Models")

This started life as a hybrid laser cut/3D printed remix for Mendel,
but evolved to incorporate ideas and parts from Printrbot, and
Wallace, plus assorted parts from Thingiverse and some brand new ones.

It is designed to be easy to assemble and to produce in bulk
quantities (i.e. less than mass-produced, more than hand-crafted).
